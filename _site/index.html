        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Recently, I haven’t been doing much reverse engineering at my day job, so I wanted to start a small side project that incorporates some reversing; security camera VR seemed like the perfect project. To avoid the devastation of finding a n-day, I specifically looked for devices that didn’t have any CVEs. Amazon’s top results for “security cameras” gave me an endless list of devices to pick from, so I chose the first option listed without CVEs, a UOKOO security camera.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/uokoo/uokoo_amazon_ad.png" alt="UOKOO Amazon Ad" /></p>

<h2>Getting User Credentials</h2>

<p>The iSmartViewPro app is used to setup the WiFi connection, customize device settings, and flash the most recent firmware update. The instruction manual gives the device’s default credentials: <code class="highlighter-rouge">admin</code> as the username and <code class="highlighter-rouge">123456</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">888888</code> as the password. These credentials are used across all UOKOO cameras, and users aren’t required to change them during setup.</p>

<p>After the device was configured, I <code class="highlighter-rouge">nmap</code>ed it and saw a server listening on port 80. Lo and behold, it was a HTTP web server prompting for device login credentials. Initially, I was disappointed that this <em>security</em> camera was ignorant of basic security practices, but after a quick glance in Wireshark, I was surprised to find it using digest access authentication (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617">RFC-2617</a>). This authentication scheme hashes the password concatenated with a server provided nonce before sending it over the network to prevent the server from receiving passwords in plaintext, while also mitigating replay attacks. According to the RFC, the authentication is supposed to take place inside a TLS connection to prevent MitM attacks. If a MitM sets the value of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">WWW-Authenticate</code> HTTP header in the server’s response to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Basic</code>, the user’s credentials will be sent in Base64 encoding which can easily be decoded.</p>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/fzBLNb4" data-context="false"><a href="//imgur.com/a/fzBLNb4">UOKOO Security Camera Login MitM</a></blockquote><script async="" src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>

<p>I’m glad that the UOKOO developers at least attempted to secure their login page, as opposed to many of their competitors, even though in reality it wasn’t effective. Between the default credentials and the insecure login page, it’s not too difficult to get the login credentials, which we’ll use later…</p>

<h2>Getting a Shell</h2>

<p>Before I started reversing, I wanted to get a shell on the device so I could read logs, debug programs, and send files to/from the device. Most IoT devices expose a serial port on the PCB that drops clients directly into a shell, so I thought I should give that a try. When the front cover of the camera is removed, the PCB presents silkscreen labeled UART pads. This saved me a few minutes of prodding around with a multimeter.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/uokoo/uokoo_board_small.jpg" alt="UOKOO PCB" /></p>

<p>Sorry about the blurry image, I apparently don’t know how to focus an iPhone camera.</p>

<p>After I soldered some wires onto the pads, I used devttys0’s baudrate brute force script to find the <code class="highlighter-rouge">115200 bps</code> baud rate. Once connected, the serial connection dropped me into a root shell—as is tradition.</p>

<h2>Attack Surface Enumeration</h2>

<p>Using the root shell, <code class="highlighter-rouge">netstat -plnt</code> showed me which programs were listening for a remote connection.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:65531           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      360/FWUpdateSvr
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:10080         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      407/hyrtspd
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:554             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      407/hyrtspd
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      407/hyrtspd
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, our attack surface was rather small because it’s a pretty dumb device. Both processes had obvious roles, given their names: <code class="highlighter-rouge">FWUpdateSvr</code> is the firmware update server and <code class="highlighter-rouge">hyrtspd</code> is a RTSP daemon. If you look closely, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hyrtspd</code> program is listening on port <code class="highlighter-rouge">80</code>, which means it’s also the HTTP server we looked at earlier.</p>

<h2>Firmware Update Protocol</h2>

<p>I decided to reverse engineer the firmware update server’s update protocol before the RTSP daemon because I knew it would parse a significant amount of unsanitized data. There are two different ways to approach this:</p>

<p>1) Reverse the iSmartViewPro Android app’s firmware update functionality<br />
2) Reverse the server-side firmware update parsing and create your own update from scratch</p>

<p>Reversing the Android app sounded super boring because I wanted to reverse some native code, not decompiled Java bytecode. If I wanted a PoC ASAP, I would have opted for the app reversing but this project is all about having fun.</p>

<p>The update servers is a small 15 kB stripped C++ program written by the developer that goes by the alias <code class="highlighter-rouge">PETER.PAN</code>, according to the startup banner.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/uokoo/uokoo_firmware_update_banner.png" alt="Firmware Update Banner" /></p>

<p>As shown in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">netstat</code> output, the server listens on port <code class="highlighter-rouge">65531</code> for the authentication message.</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">struct uokoo_firmware_update_authentication_message
{
    unsigned char unknown[4];
    unsigned char username[32];
    unsigned char password[32];
};
</code></pre>

<p>The username and password are send in plaintext, which means a passive MitM can get the credentials. Now we have three vectors to expose login credentials:</p>

<p>1) Use the default username and password
2) MitM the login request
3) Passively MitM a firmware update</p>

<p>When the server accepts a connection, it immediately creates a CDBManager object (implemented in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">libdbmanager.so</code> library) which opens a connection to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/db/ipcsys.db</code> SQLite database. It then calls the CDBManager’s QryUserInfoFromDBByID method which executes the follow SQL query:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">C_UserName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c_role_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">C_PassWord</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c_role_name</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">v_user_role_detail</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">C_UserID</span><span class="o">=%</span><span class="n">d</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">C_UserID</code> field is set to 10001, which is the user ID of the admin user. The QryUserInfoFromDBByID method returns a response in an <code class="highlighter-rouge">USERINFOQRY</code> structure:</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">struct USERINFOQRY
{
    uint32_t user_id;   // Not set in this query
    uint64_t role_id;   // From the c_role_id field
    char username[32];  // From the C_UserName field
    char password[32];  // From the C_PassWord field
    uint32_t role_name; // From the c_role_name field
};
</code></pre>

<p>The server <code class="highlighter-rouge">strcmp</code> compares the username and password fields from the firmware update’s authentication messages with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">C_UserID</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">C_PassWord</code> credentials from the database.</p>

<p><img src="./images/auth_message_check.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If both usernames and passwords match, the client is authenticated and the server returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">HY01</code> to denote successful authentication. The client then sends the firmware update header.</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">// Bit mask for the firmware update header's update flag
#define UPDATE_USER_BIN_AND_DB 1
#define UPDATE_KERNEL          2
#define UPDATE_ROOT_FS         4
#define BACKUP_IPC_SYS_DB      8

struct uokoo_firmware_update_header
{
    unsigned char update_type[4];
    unsigned char crc[4];
    unsigned char compressed_update_size[4];
    unsigned char decompressed_update_size[4];
    unsigned char update_flag;
    unsigned char update_type_number;
    unsigned char padding;
    unsigned char hardware_version[2];
    unsigned char padding[27];
};
</code></pre>

<p>The firmware update type is either <code class="highlighter-rouge">HY01</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">HY02</code>. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">HY01</code> type skips the hardware version check while the <code class="highlighter-rouge">HY02</code> rejects updates that do not match the current firmware’s hardware version.</p>

<p>The CRC field is logged server-side but never checked so it can be ignored.</p>

<p>The update sizes are used to determine if the device has enough storage to apply the update. The server calls <code class="highlighter-rouge">statfs</code> on <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/</code> to determine the amount of free space it has. It then compares the amount of free space to the update header’s decompressed update size. If there’s not enough space left on the device, it rejects the update. I’d strongly recommend not fudging the decompressed update size because it could brick the device.</p>

<p>The update flag is a bit field representing what parts of the device the firmware update will apply to.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">UPDATE_USER_BIN_AND_DB</code>: Updates the <code class="highlighter-rouge">user.bin</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">mtd_db.bin</code> by flashing <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/user/user.bin</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/mtd3</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/user/mtd_db.bin</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/mtd4</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/user/mtd_dbback.bin</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/mtd5</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">UPDATE_KERNEL</code>: Updates the kernel by flashing <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/kernel/kernel.bin</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/mtd1</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">UPDATE_ROOT_FS</code>: Updates the <code class="highlighter-rouge">rootfs</code> by flashing <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/rootfs/rootfs.bin</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/mtd2</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">BACKUP_IPC_SYS_DB</code>: Creates a backup of the device’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/ipcsys.db</code> database in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/dbback</code>. All other modifications are ignored.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, the hardware version is only checked if the update type is <code class="highlighter-rouge">HY02</code>. The hardware version can be seen from the device’s web interface in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Set Up</code> -&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">About</code> -&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">System Firmware</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/uokoo/uokoo_firmware_version.png" alt="Firmware Version" /></p>

<p>The hardware version is between the first and second period. For example, in the image above the firmware version is <code class="highlighter-rouge">00.30.01.0049P4</code> so the hardware version would be the ASCII value <code class="highlighter-rouge">30</code>. This firmware version is stored on the device in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/etc/ipcversion</code>.</p>

<p>After the header is validated, the server responds with <code class="highlighter-rouge">HY01</code>. It then starts reading the firmware update in 0x400 byte chunks to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/tmp_update.zip</code>. The firmware update is expected to be in zip format, which is later unzipped in the root directory.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/uokoo/uokoo_unpack_update.png" alt="Unpack Update" /></p>

<p>If we send a firmware update that passes all the firmware update server’s checks, we get an arbitrary file write primitive! After the update server applies all updates, it reboots the device. The following snippet shows the server logs of a successful update, before rebooting, with the firmware upgrade zip containing pwn.txt.</p>

<h2>RCE and Persistence</h2>

<p>The easiest way to achieve RCE in this situation is to overwrite a file that later gets executed. Before we start looking for an executable to target, we need to know which filesystems are mounted with write permissions.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[root@GM]# mount
rootfs on / type rootfs (rw)
/dev/root on / type squashfs (ro,relatime)
tmpfs on /dev type tmpfs (rw,relatime,mode=755)
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,relatime,mode=777)
tmpfs on /var type tmpfs (rw,relatime,mode=755)
tmpfs on /bin type tmpfs (rw,relatime,mode=755)
tmpfs on /usr type tmpfs (rw,relatime,mode=755)
tmpfs on /sbin type tmpfs (rw,relatime,mode=755)
/dev/sys on /sys type sysfs (rw,relatime)
none on /proc type proc (rw,relatime)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,relatime,mode=600,ptmxmode=000)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,relatime,size=49152k)
/dev/mtdblock3 on /mnt/mtd type jffs2 (rw,relatime)
/dev/mtdblock4 on /mnt/mtd/db type jffs2 (rw,relatime)
/dev/mtdblock5 on /mnt/mtd/dbback type jffs2 (rw,relatime)
tmpfs on /etc type tmpfs (rw,relatime,mode=755)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Additionally, the file must be written to a filesystem that persists reboots because the device is rebooted immediately after the firmware update. Since the root directory is read-only and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmpfs</code> directories do not persist, our scope was limited to executables in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">jffs2</code> directories. Initially, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">vg_boot.sh</code> script was an appealing target because it persisted modification and executed on boot. The downside was that it contained commands that were specific to the device model which would make porting the exploit a pain. I kept searching and eventually found the absolute best-case scenario in the middle of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/etc/start.sh</code> script.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">filelist</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sb">`</span><span class="nb">ls</span> /mnt/mtd/etc/app<span class="sb">`</span>
<span class="k">for </span>file <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nv">$filelist</span>
<span class="k">do
 </span><span class="nb">chmod</span> +x /mnt/mtd/etc/app/<span class="nv">$file</span>
 /bin/sh /mnt/mtd/etc/app/<span class="nv">$file</span> &amp;
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It executes every file in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/etc/app/</code> on boot, which is a directory that is writable and persists reboots! The full exploit chain would follow the steps:</p>

<p>1) Create a zip file with our executable payload in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mntd/mtd/etc/app/</code><br />
2) Use the default or exposed credentials to send the zip file as a firmware update<br />
3) Wait for the firmware update server to reboot the device<br />
4) <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/etc/start.sh</code> gets executed on boot which then executes every file in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/etc/app</code>, including our payload!</p>

<p>I’ve released the exploit <a href="https://github.com/0xf15h/uokoo_exploit">here</a> on GitHub which sends a firmware update that writes <code class="highlighter-rouge">dropbear</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/etc/</code> and give us remote persistent access to the camera.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>This weekend I got stuck on a level in Super Meat Boy and needed to take a break so I decided to poke around the binary
for a bit. I started with a bit of recon by checking out some of the files that shipped with the binary.</p>

<p>The first file I looked at was locdb.txt, which is just a text file containing the game’s strings in various languages.
Each string and its translations were on their own line with each translated string separated by a tab character. This
wasn’t very interesting so I kept looking around for something better.</p>

<p>The UserData/savegame.dat file caught my eye and got me thinking… What if I could just modify the save file to tell
the game I’ve completed the level that I’m stuck on?! With this goal in mind I loaded up the binary in Ghidra and got
to work.</p>

<p>Super Meat Boy uses a custom game engine, called Tommunism, which is written in C++. The game engine is statically
linked with the game so we don’t get any helpful import or export function signatures. To make matters worse, there
aren’t too many string references in the binary because they’re stored in locdb.txt and loaded at runtime. I quickly
found myself getting overwhelmed by deep inheritance trees because I wasn’t just reversing a game, I was reversing a
game engine too! A dynamic analysis approach was definitely needed.</p>

<p>I found a string reference to savegame.dat that eventually gets passed to a WinAPI CreateFileA call. With x64dbg, I set
a breakpoint on CreateFileA to get the savegame.dat file’s HANDLE. The breakpoint was triggered after pressing start on
the game’s title screen. I then set a breakpoint for the WinAPI ReadFile function to get the address
of the buffer that the data was read into. From there, I set a memory access breakpoint on the buffer so it would break
when the buffer was getting parsed. The breakpoint was triggered in a memcpy and I used the breakpoint’s stacktrace
to pinpoint the functions of interest. Again, I was greeted with inheritance hierarchy hell but I was able to make sense
of it with dynamic analysis. The first DWORD of the savegame.dat file was compared to 0x31304653 (“10FS” in ASCII). If
they were equal, it would skip over a huge code block that continued parsing the save file. I overwrote the first DWORD
of my save file with the hard coded value and restarted my client. It unlocked chapters one, two, four, six, and seven
with every level in the chapter unlocked with an A+ rating! The Dark World levels were completed too!</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Nsn4QAS.png" alt="Unlocked chapters" title="Unlocked chapters after overwriting the save file" /></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2K4QvYf.png" alt="Unlocked levels" title="Unlocked levels after overwriting the save file" /></p>

<p>This code was probably used for testing during development and accidentally made it into production. It could
easily be patched out by the developers if they wanted to, but I don’t see why they’d bother since it’s a single player
game. Anyway I ended up restoring my old save file to avoid ruining the game. Hopefully this time I can beat the level
without resorting to cheating.</p>
