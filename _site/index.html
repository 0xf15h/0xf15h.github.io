          <h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>The TP-Link developers created a <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi_gdpr</code> endpoint to support various encrypted requests to comply by the EU’s GDPR. Several issues were found while auditing the authentication protocol and implementation, some of which are easily exploitable.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The AES-128 key and IV, which are used to encrypt the username and password, are almost entirely generated from the current time. This allows a passive MitM to brute force decrypt the login requests in seconds. I’ve written a Scapy script that will parse a PCAP to find a login request and brute force decrypt it <a href="">[link]</a>.</li>
  <li>On server boot, the web server generates an RSA public/private key-pair. If any of the memory allocations for the keys fail, hardcoded keys to use instead.</li>
  <li>The server uses RSA without padding which makes the ciphertext deterministic. TP-Link’s authentication implementation and the deterministic RSA encrypt enables attackers to attempt to crack the password offline. I’ve written a PoC on GitHub that demonstrates offline password cracking <a href="">[link]</a>.</li>
  <li>The server requires a server issued sequence field to be included in the RSA encrypt functions to prevent replay attacks. The sequence can be modified based on the data length provided, which can be easily modified without affecting the data decryption and enable a replay attack of a login request.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming one of the listed vulnerabilities were exploited to expose login credentials, a 3 year old unpatched post-auth command injection exploit was used to gain telnet access to the fully patched Archer C20.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I was bored during the COVID-19 lockdown so I started bug hunting on the cheapest router I could find at Micro Center, the TP-Link Archer C20. This router was the ideal target because it’s cheap and has a rather large attack surface compared to other $35 IoT devices.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/tp_link_gdpr/tp_link_archer_c20_micro_center.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I played around with the web UI while Wireshark captured the network traffic. While reviewing the PCAP, I noticed that many of the requests, excluding requests for static files, were encrypted. Each encrypted request was sent to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi_gdpr</code> endpoint.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/tp_link_gdpr/cgi_gdpr_endpoint_in_pcap.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) defines some legal standards for protecting users’ privacy in the EU with respect to technology. TP-Link probably added this to comply by GDPR, hence <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi_gdpr</code>. Additionally, the TP-Link changelog for the Archer C20 mentions enabling modifying the login mode “as required by law” <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/download/archer-c20/#Firmware">[link]</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210318103158/https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/download/archer-c20/">[archive]</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/tp_link_gdpr/firmware_changelog.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Before I start looking for memory corruption bugs, I first need to understand the new encryption scheme so I can send malformed requests.</p>

<h2>Authentication Protocol</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/tp_link_gdpr/auth_protocol.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>From the perspective of a passive network observer, a client authenticates with the router through two HTTP endpoints: <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi/getParm</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi_gdpr</code>. The web server’s RSA public key’s e and n values are retrieved via an HTTP GET request to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi/getParm</code> endpoint. The response also includes a server generated sequence, which will later be used as RSA encryption entropy. An AES-128 key and IV are generated client-side, which will be used later to encrypt all request payloads sent to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi_gdpr</code> endpoint. Requests to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi_gdpr</code> are composed of two fields: sign and data. The encryption and encoding scheme for both fields is defined below.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sign=base64_encode(rsa_encrypt(key=&lt;aes_key&gt;&amp;iv=&lt;cbc_iv&gt;&amp;h=&lt;username_and_passwd_hash&gt;&amp;s=&lt;sequence_plus_data_len&gt;))
data=base64_encode(aes_encrypt(payload))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The data field contains a PKCS7 padded payload that is AES-128 CBC encrypted using the newly generated AES key and IV. The data field’s payload is in a janky INI format containing the HTTP endpoint, request configuration, and the request data. During authentication, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi_gdpr</code> request’s data field payload is referred to as the login message. An example of a login message is shown below.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>8
[/cgi/login#0,0,0,0,0,0#0,0,0,0,0,0]0,2
username=admin
password=password123
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The login message sets the HTTP endpoint to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi/login</code> and the request data to the credentials in plaintext. The web interface only accepts a password and hardcodes the username to <code class="highlighter-rouge">admin</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/tp_link_gdpr/tp_link_login_page.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi_gdpr</code> request’s sign field contains the the newly generated AES key and IV, an MD5 hash of the username concatenated with the password, and the sequence from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/get/Parm</code> request. The sign field is RSA encrypted using the public key retrieved from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi/getParm</code> request. Both data and sign fields are Base64 encoded then sent to the web server’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi_gdpr</code> endpoint via an HTTP POST request. The server uses its private key to decrypt the sign field. It verifies that the sequence number in the sign field is equal to the server generated sequence number plus the data length. The server then retrieve the AES key and IV and use them decrypt the data field. The decrypted data field is parsed and it sends the request to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi/login</code> endpoint’s handler function. The handler verifies that the username and password specified in the login message match the previously configured username and password. If the credentials are valid the server returns an HTTP OK.</p>

<h2>Vulnerabilities</h2>

<h3>AES Key Entropy Source</h3>

<p>During authentication, the client generates an AES key and IV to encrypt the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi_gdpr</code> request’s data field. Let’s take a look at the function that generates the keys.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/0xf15h/23a8346efd64521cd16d4aaed828c3ac.js"></script>

<p>It’s clearly not using cryptographically strong random values from a crypto API <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto">[link]</a>, but it gets worse. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">+ "" +</code> is forcing string concatenation, <strong>not</strong> arithmetic addition. This means that if the getTime return value is large enough, the remaining entropy can be ignored.</p>

<p>The documentation for the getTime method states that it returns the milliseconds since Unix Epoch <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTime">[link]</a>. If I were to generate a timestamp as of writing this blog post, it would return <code class="highlighter-rouge">1618861383008</code>, which is 13 characters long. This 13 character number is cast to a decimal string representation, concatenated with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Math.random()</code> value, then truncated to fit into <code class="highlighter-rouge">KEY_LEN</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">IV_LEN</code> which is 16 bytes long. Since the timestamp is 13 characters, it occupies 13 of the 16 bytes of the key! A passive MitM could observe a login request and easily brute force the remaining 3 bytes of entropy to decrypt the login message. The time of the key generation will be slightly before the time it’s observed over the network, but brute forcing up to a second before a given observation time will still only take seconds.</p>

<p>The AES key and IV are generated at different times and have different 3 bytes of entropy. The naïve approach is to brute force the key and IV with O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity. For each AES key brute force attempt, run another brute force routine for the IV. There’s a faster O(n) solution if we consider how CBC decryption works.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/tp_link_gdpr/cbc_decryption.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first block of ciphertext c0 is decrypted into an intermediary value c0′. The c0′ value must be XORed with the IV before revealing the plaintext. After viewing several different login messages, notice that the first 16 bytes (AES block size) are always the same: <code class="highlighter-rouge">8\r\n[/cgi/login#0</code>. If we take this know plaintext value and XOR it with c0′, it’ll reveal the IV. If the top 10 bytes of the calculated IV match the top 10 bytes of the brute forced key, which are the Unix Epoch timestamps down to the second, both the AES key and IV have been found. Using this method, an attacker only needs to brute force the AES key space in O(n) time because the IV check can be done in a constant O(1) check. I’ve written a Scapy script that parses a PCAP to find the login request, gets the packet timestamp, then cracks the AES key and IV to reveal the credentials in plaintext <a href="">[link]</a>.</p>

<h3>Default RSA Key</h3>

<p>The RSA public/private key-pair are generated on the first <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi/getParm</code> request. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">http_rsa_getPubKey</code> function calls <code class="highlighter-rouge">generate_rsa_private_key</code> if the global RSA n value has not been generated yet.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/tp_link_gdpr/tp_link_gen_rsa_keys.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This generate_rsa_private_key function allocates buffers for the RSA n, e, and d hex strings.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/tp_link_gdpr/tp_link_gen_rsa_private_key.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If any hex string malloc fails, -1 is returned. In <code class="highlighter-rouge">http_rsa_getPubKey</code>, if -1 is returned from <code class="highlighter-rouge">generate_rsa_private_key</code> it will fallback to hardcoded values in the .data section. Ideally, an attacker would attempt to control the size of the malloc but it’s hardcoded to a relatively small value. Given this constraint, an attacker can still cause the default keys to be used given two conditions.</p>

<p>1) Remotely control when a buffer is malloced and free across any service on the router (e.g. UPnP, HTTP, CWMP, SSH)<br />
2) The <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi/getParm</code> endpoint has not been requested since the device booted</p>

<p>Assuming an attacker satisfies both requirements, they could put the router into a state that would cause subsequent mallocs to fail by issuing many requests that call malloc without freeing until a later time. The attacker would then make a request to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi/getParm</code> endpoint and cause the device to set the global public/private key-pair to the known default keys. These hardcoded keys would persist until the device is rebooted. The attacker would free the previously allocated buffers, restoring the router to state where mallocs succeed. Now whenever a legitimate user authenticates with the router, the attacker could decrypt the sign field and expose the AES key and IV. The key and IV would then be used to decrypt the data field and expose the login credentials in plaintext.</p>

<h3>RSA without Padding</h3>

<p>The sign field of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi_gdpr</code> requests use RSA without padding so the ciphertext is deterministic. If the same messages is encrypted twice by the same RSA public key, it produces the same ciphertext each time. Given TP-Link’s authentication implementation and deterministic RSA, an attacker can ultimately create an offline password cracker.</p>

<p>RSA can only encrypt a relatively small input, e.g. 128 byte input, excluding padding, for a 1024-bit key. TP-Link encrypted larger messages by breaking the input into 64 byte blocks and padding the last block with null bytes. Let’s look at an example of an <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi_gdpr</code> request’s sign field.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>key=1617857002547232&amp;iv=1617857002547416&amp;h=bb0f7e021d52a4e31613d463fc0525d8&amp;s=271058692
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The key and IV will always be 16 characters long because each character is a byte and the AES block size is 16 bytes. The authentication hash will always be 32 characters long because it’s a hex string, where each character represents 4 bits of the 16 byte hash. The sequence can vary slightly in length, but it’s known to a passive observer. TP-Link would break this example into into 64 byte blocks like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Python">rsa_blocks[0] = "key=1617857002547232&amp;iv=1617857002547416&amp;h=bb0f7e021d52a4e31613d"
rsa_blocks[1] = "463fc0525d8&amp;s=271058692"
</code></pre>

<p>An attacker could not feasibly attempt offline hash cracking on the first block unless they know the key and IV. The second block is a different case because it only contains part of the authentication hash and the sequence. The sequence field can be calculated by a passive observer: the sequence value returned by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi/getParm</code> request plus the length of the Base64 encoded data field in the subsequent <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi_gdpr</code> request. This means the attacker would only be guessing at the last 44 bits of the MD5 hash which is perfect for offline hash cracking. An attacker would know that they’ve cracked the password when the ciphertext produced by their guess matches the ciphertext from the original sign field.</p>

<pre><code class="language-Python">rsa_blocks[1] == rsa_encrypt(md5("admin" + &lt;password_guess&gt;)[-11:] + "&amp;s=" + sequence)
</code></pre>

<p>The admin string comes from the hardcoded username, described in the authentication protocol section. I’ve written an offline hash crack proof of concept for this example <a href="">[link]</a>.</p>

<h3>Replay Attack</h3>

<p>When <code class="highlighter-rouge">/getParm</code> is requested, a new global sequence number is generated server-side by taking a random 4 byte value, from <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/urandom</code>, modulo 0x40000000. The sequence number is returned to the client with the RSA e and n values. The client must put the sequence field in every <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi_gdpr</code> request’s sign field, as an attempt to add entropy to the RSA encryption. When the user attempts a login, it will recalculate the sequence number: the server’s global sequence value plus the length, derived from strlen, of the Base64 encoded data field. An attacker can modify the sequence value by increasing the length of the Base64 encoded data. Adding bytes to encoded and encrypted data can lead to data corruption which will cause the decode or decrypt to fail. Additionally, given the replay attack model, an attacker does not have the key to legitimately increase the data length. Luckily, TP-Link implemented their own Base64 decode which recalculates the string length.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/tp_link_gdpr/tp_link_b64_decode.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As shown in the decompiled snippet from Ghidra, it truncates the string by either the min value of strlen or the first space character it sees (hex character 0x20). An attacker could keep requesting <code class="highlighter-rouge">/getParm</code> until a sequence number that is slightly less than the previous sequence number. The attacker could then send the previous login request from a legitimate user with the same sign and data fields, but add space characters after the Base64 data until the sequence number matches the previous sequence number. The router will call strlen of the Base64 data and add it to the server’s global sequence number to calculate the expected sequence number. The web server will RSA decrypt the sign field and verify the authentication hash (which the attacker still does not know) and the sequence field. Both checks will succeed. When the server later Base64 decodes the data field, it will ignore the space characters used to increase the data length and sequence value.</p>

<h3>Padding Oracle</h3>

<p>In the <code class="highlighter-rouge">aes_tmp_decrypt_buf_nopadding_new</code> function in libgdpr.so, the remove_padding function returns the number of padding bytes. The web client uses PKCS7 padding, which repeats the number of padding bytes as padding (e.g. 7 padding bytes would be <code class="highlighter-rouge">\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07</code>). The function gets the last byte, ensures it’s less than or equal to the block size, then returns it. Note that it does not verify that the previous bytes are equal to the padding value. Additionally, if the remove_padding function fails and returns -1, it will not return a unique failure (i.e. no oracle) and will continue and fail during later parsing.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/tp_link_gdpr/tp_link_no_padding_oracle.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Shout out to the TP-Link developers; this is a tricky one to remember!</p>

<h2>We have creds! Now what?</h2>

<p>Let’s assume an attacker now has the login credentials by leveraging one of the three vulnerabilities described above:</p>

<p>1) Brute forcing the AES key and IV based on the time the login request was sent<br />
2) Hash cracking the password in the sign field of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi_gdpr</code> request<br />
3) Exhausting system memory before <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi/getParm</code> was requested, causing the router to default to hardcoded RSA keys</p>

<p>Our attack surface has vastly increased because post-auth request handlers are now reachable. After playing around with the web interface for a bit, I found that the router allows users to backup and restore their device configuration. The configuration restore is an interesting attack surface because the web server will have to parse a lot of attacker controlled data. I backed up a my current device config to see how the file is formatted, but it was encrypted.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/tp_link_gdpr/tp_link_binwalk_entropy.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To understand how the config was encrypted, I looked at the web servers handler function for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/cgi/confencode</code> endpoint. The handler function used DES encryption with a hardcoded key in libcmm.so.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/tp_link_gdpr/tp_link_hard_coded_des_key.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Using this key, we can decrypt the config file and see the giant XML config. I wanted to see if I was the only researcher who was looking at this attack surface so I Googled the hardcoded key. It turns out that I wasn’t alone.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/tp_link_gdpr/tp_link_config_key_google.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The tpconf_bin_xml GitHub repository handles the encryption/decryption and compression/decompression of TP-Link config files <a href="https://github.com/sta-c0000/tpconf_bin_xml">[link]</a>. It also describes a command injection vulnerability found in the Description field in the DeviceInfo section. It was developed for the TP-Link TD-W9970, but I gave it a try on the Archer C20 and it worked!</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Downloaded the current config as ArcherC20V520121442010n.bin</span>

<p>Now we have a remote root shell! It’s pretty depressing that this n-day has been on GitHub for three years and still isn’t patched on firmware that was updated on 1/27/2021. I hope TP-Link eventually gets around to patching it across any or all device models.</p>

<h2>Security Recommendations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Use cryptographically strong entropy from a crypto API when generating AES keys <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto">[link]</a></li>
  <li>Generate the RSA public/private key-pair during the web server initialization on boot. If any malloc in <code class="highlighter-rouge">generate_rsa_private_key</code> fails, consider it an unrecoverable error and force the web server to exit.</li>
  <li>Use PKCS#1 padding when using RSA</li>
  <li>Do not modify the sequence entropy value to mitigate replay attacks</li>
  <li>Patch open source n-days</li>
</ul>

          <p>Recently, I haven’t been doing much reverse engineering at my day job, so I wanted to start a small side project that incorporates some reversing; security camera VR seemed like the perfect project. To avoid the devastation of finding a n-day, I specifically looked for devices that didn’t have any CVEs. Amazon’s top results for “security cameras” gave me an endless list of devices to pick from, so I chose the first option listed without CVEs, a UOKOO security camera.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/uokoo/uokoo_amazon_ad.png" alt="UOKOO Amazon Ad" /></p>

<h2>Getting User Credentials</h2>

<p>The iSmartViewPro app is used to setup the WiFi connection, customize device settings, and flash the most recent firmware update. The instruction manual gives the device’s default credentials: <code class="highlighter-rouge">admin</code> as the username and <code class="highlighter-rouge">123456</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">888888</code> as the password. These credentials are used across all UOKOO cameras, and users aren’t required to change them during setup.</p>

<p>After the device was configured, I <code class="highlighter-rouge">nmap</code>ed it and saw a server listening on port 80. Lo and behold, it was a HTTP web server prompting for device login credentials. Initially, I was disappointed that this <em>security</em> camera was ignorant of basic security practices, but after a quick glance in Wireshark, I was surprised to find it using digest access authentication (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617">RFC-2617</a>). This authentication scheme hashes the password concatenated with a server provided nonce before sending it over the network to prevent the server from receiving passwords in plaintext, while also mitigating replay attacks. According to the RFC, the authentication is supposed to take place inside a TLS connection to prevent MitM attacks. If a MitM sets the value of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">WWW-Authenticate</code> HTTP header in the server’s response to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Basic</code>, the user’s credentials will be sent in Base64 encoding which can easily be decoded.</p>

<p>I’m glad that the UOKOO developers at least attempted to secure their login page, as opposed to many of their competitors, even though in reality it wasn’t effective. Between the default credentials and the insecure login page, it’s not too difficult to get the login credentials, which we’ll use later…</p>

<h2>Getting a Shell</h2>

<p>Before I started reversing, I wanted to get a shell on the device so I could read logs, debug programs, and send files to/from the device. Most IoT devices expose a serial port on the PCB that drops clients directly into a shell, so I thought I should give that a try. When the front cover of the camera is removed, the PCB presents silkscreen labeled UART pads. This saved me a few minutes of prodding around with a multimeter.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/uokoo/uokoo_board_small.jpg" alt="UOKOO PCB" /></p>

<p>Sorry about the blurry image, I apparently don’t know how to focus an iPhone camera.</p>

<p>After I soldered some wires onto the pads, I used devttys0’s baudrate brute force script to find the <code class="highlighter-rouge">115200 bps</code> baud rate. Once connected, the serial connection dropped me into a root shell—as is tradition.</p>

<h2>Attack Surface Enumeration</h2>

<p>Using the root shell, <code class="highlighter-rouge">netstat -plnt</code> showed me which programs were listening for a remote connection.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:65531           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      360/FWUpdateSvr
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:10080         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      407/hyrtspd
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:554             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      407/hyrtspd
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      407/hyrtspd
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, our attack surface was rather small because it’s a pretty dumb device. Both processes had obvious roles, given their names: <code class="highlighter-rouge">FWUpdateSvr</code> is the firmware update server and <code class="highlighter-rouge">hyrtspd</code> is a RTSP daemon. If you look closely, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hyrtspd</code> program is listening on port <code class="highlighter-rouge">80</code>, which means it’s also the HTTP server we looked at earlier.</p>

<h2>Firmware Update Protocol</h2>

<p>I decided to reverse engineer the firmware update server’s update protocol before the RTSP daemon because I knew it would parse a significant amount of unsanitized data. There are two different ways to approach this:</p>

<p>1) Reverse the iSmartViewPro Android app’s firmware update functionality<br />
2) Reverse the server-side firmware update parsing and create your own update from scratch</p>

<p>Reversing the Android app sounded super boring because I wanted to reverse some native code, not decompiled Java bytecode. If I wanted a PoC ASAP, I would have opted for the app reversing but this project is all about having fun.</p>

<p>The update servers is a small 15 kB stripped C++ program written by the developer that goes by the alias <code class="highlighter-rouge">PETER.PAN</code>, according to the startup banner.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/uokoo/uokoo_firmware_update_banner.png" alt="Firmware Update Banner" /></p>

<p>As shown in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">netstat</code> output, the server listens on port <code class="highlighter-rouge">65531</code> for the authentication message.</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">struct uokoo_firmware_update_authentication_message
{
    unsigned char unknown[4];
    unsigned char username[32];
    unsigned char password[32];
};
</code></pre>

<p>The username and password are send in plaintext, which means a passive MitM can get the credentials. Now we have three vectors to expose login credentials:</p>

<p>1) Use the default username and password<br />
2) MitM the login request<br />
3) Passively MitM a firmware update</p>

<p>When the server accepts a connection, it immediately creates a CDBManager object (implemented in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">libdbmanager.so</code> library) which opens a connection to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/db/ipcsys.db</code> SQLite database. It then calls the CDBManager’s QryUserInfoFromDBByID method which executes the follow SQL query:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">C_UserName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c_role_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">C_PassWord</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c_role_name</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">v_user_role_detail</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">C_UserID</span><span class="o">=%</span><span class="n">d</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">C_UserID</code> field is set to 10001, which is the user ID of the admin user. The QryUserInfoFromDBByID method returns a response in an <code class="highlighter-rouge">USERINFOQRY</code> structure:</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">struct USERINFOQRY
{
    uint32_t user_id;   // Not set in this query
    uint64_t role_id;   // From the c_role_id field
    char username[32];  // From the C_UserName field
    char password[32];  // From the C_PassWord field
    uint32_t role_name; // From the c_role_name field
};
</code></pre>

<p>The server <code class="highlighter-rouge">strcmp</code> compares the username and password fields from the firmware update’s authentication messages with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">C_UserID</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">C_PassWord</code> credentials from the database.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/uokoo/auth_message_check.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If both usernames and passwords match, the client is authenticated and the server returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">HY01</code> to denote successful authentication. The client then sends the firmware update header.</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">// Bit mask for the firmware update header's update flag
#define UPDATE_USER_BIN_AND_DB 1
#define UPDATE_KERNEL          2
#define UPDATE_ROOT_FS         4
#define BACKUP_IPC_SYS_DB      8

struct uokoo_firmware_update_header
{
    unsigned char update_type[4];
    unsigned char crc[4];
    unsigned char compressed_update_size[4];
    unsigned char decompressed_update_size[4];
    unsigned char update_flag;
    unsigned char update_type_number;
    unsigned char padding;
    unsigned char hardware_version[2];
    unsigned char padding[27];
};
</code></pre>

<p>The firmware update type is either <code class="highlighter-rouge">HY01</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">HY02</code>. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">HY01</code> type skips the hardware version check while the <code class="highlighter-rouge">HY02</code> rejects updates that do not match the current firmware’s hardware version.</p>

<p>The CRC field is logged server-side but never checked so it can be ignored.</p>

<p>The update sizes are used to determine if the device has enough storage to apply the update. The server calls <code class="highlighter-rouge">statfs</code> on <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/</code> to determine the amount of free space it has. It then compares the amount of free space to the update header’s decompressed update size. If there’s not enough space left on the device, it rejects the update. I’d strongly recommend not fudging the decompressed update size because it could brick the device.</p>

<p>The update flag is a bit field representing what parts of the device the firmware update will apply to.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">UPDATE_USER_BIN_AND_DB</code>: Updates the <code class="highlighter-rouge">user.bin</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">mtd_db.bin</code> by flashing <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/user/user.bin</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/mtd3</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/user/mtd_db.bin</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/mtd4</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/user/mtd_dbback.bin</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/mtd5</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">UPDATE_KERNEL</code>: Updates the kernel by flashing <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/kernel/kernel.bin</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/mtd1</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">UPDATE_ROOT_FS</code>: Updates the <code class="highlighter-rouge">rootfs</code> by flashing <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/rootfs/rootfs.bin</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/mtd2</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">BACKUP_IPC_SYS_DB</code>: Creates a backup of the device’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/ipcsys.db</code> database in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/dbback</code>. All other modifications are ignored.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, the hardware version is only checked if the update type is <code class="highlighter-rouge">HY02</code>. The hardware version can be seen from the device’s web interface in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Set Up</code> -&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">About</code> -&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">System Firmware</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/uokoo/uokoo_firmware_version.png" alt="Firmware Version" /></p>

<p>The hardware version is between the first and second period. For example, in the image above the firmware version is <code class="highlighter-rouge">00.30.01.0049P4</code> so the hardware version would be the ASCII value <code class="highlighter-rouge">30</code>. This firmware version is stored on the device in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/etc/ipcversion</code>.</p>

<p>After the header is validated, the server responds with <code class="highlighter-rouge">HY01</code>. It then starts reading the firmware update in 0x400 byte chunks to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/tmp_update.zip</code>. The firmware update is expected to be in zip format, which is later unzipped in the root directory.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/uokoo/uokoo_unpack_update.png" alt="Unpack Update" /></p>

<p>If we send a firmware update that passes all the firmware update server’s checks, we get an arbitrary file write primitive! After the update server applies all updates, it reboots the device. The following snippet shows the server logs of a successful update, before rebooting, with the firmware upgrade zip containing pwn.txt.</p>

<h2>RCE and Persistence</h2>

<p>The easiest way to achieve RCE in this situation is to overwrite a file that later gets executed. Before we start looking for an executable to target, we need to know which filesystems are mounted with write permissions.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[root@GM]# mount
rootfs on / type rootfs (rw)
/dev/root on / type squashfs (ro,relatime)
tmpfs on /dev type tmpfs (rw,relatime,mode=755)
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,relatime,mode=777)
tmpfs on /var type tmpfs (rw,relatime,mode=755)
tmpfs on /bin type tmpfs (rw,relatime,mode=755)
tmpfs on /usr type tmpfs (rw,relatime,mode=755)
tmpfs on /sbin type tmpfs (rw,relatime,mode=755)
/dev/sys on /sys type sysfs (rw,relatime)
none on /proc type proc (rw,relatime)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,relatime,mode=600,ptmxmode=000)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,relatime,size=49152k)
/dev/mtdblock3 on /mnt/mtd type jffs2 (rw,relatime)
/dev/mtdblock4 on /mnt/mtd/db type jffs2 (rw,relatime)
/dev/mtdblock5 on /mnt/mtd/dbback type jffs2 (rw,relatime)
tmpfs on /etc type tmpfs (rw,relatime,mode=755)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Additionally, the file must be written to a filesystem that persists reboots because the device is rebooted immediately after the firmware update. Since the root directory is read-only and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmpfs</code> directories do not persist, our scope was limited to executables in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">jffs2</code> directories. Initially, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">vg_boot.sh</code> script was an appealing target because it persisted modification and executed on boot. The downside was that it contained commands that were specific to the device model which would make porting the exploit a pain. I kept searching and eventually found the absolute best-case scenario in the middle of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/etc/start.sh</code> script.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">filelist</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sb">`</span><span class="nb">ls</span> /mnt/mtd/etc/app<span class="sb">`</span>
<span class="k">for </span>file <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nv">$filelist</span>
<span class="k">do
 </span><span class="nb">chmod</span> +x /mnt/mtd/etc/app/<span class="nv">$file</span>
 /bin/sh /mnt/mtd/etc/app/<span class="nv">$file</span> &amp;
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It executes every file in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/etc/app/</code> on boot, which is a directory that is writable and persists reboots! The full exploit chain would follow the steps:</p>

<p>1) Create a zip file with our executable payload in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mntd/mtd/etc/app/</code><br />
2) Use the default or exposed credentials to send the zip file as a firmware update<br />
3) Wait for the firmware update server to reboot the device<br />
4) <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/etc/start.sh</code> gets executed on boot which then executes every file in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/etc/app</code>, including our payload!</p>

<p>I’ve released the exploit <a href="https://github.com/0xf15h/uokoo_exploit">here</a> on GitHub which sends a firmware update that writes <code class="highlighter-rouge">dropbear</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/mtd/etc/</code> and give us remote persistent access to the camera.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>This weekend I got stuck on a level in Super Meat Boy and needed to take a break so I decided to poke around the binary
for a bit. I started with a bit of recon by checking out some of the files that shipped with the binary.</p>

<p>The first file I looked at was locdb.txt, which is just a text file containing the game’s strings in various languages.
Each string and its translations were on their own line with each translated string separated by a tab character. This
wasn’t very interesting so I kept looking around for something better.</p>

<p>The UserData/savegame.dat file caught my eye and got me thinking… What if I could just modify the save file to tell
the game I’ve completed the level that I’m stuck on?! With this goal in mind I loaded up the binary in Ghidra and got
to work.</p>

<p>Super Meat Boy uses a custom game engine, called Tommunism, which is written in C++. The game engine is statically
linked with the game so we don’t get any helpful import or export function signatures. To make matters worse, there
aren’t too many string references in the binary because they’re stored in locdb.txt and loaded at runtime. I quickly
found myself getting overwhelmed by deep inheritance trees because I wasn’t just reversing a game, I was reversing a
game engine too! A dynamic analysis approach was definitely needed.</p>

<p>I found a string reference to savegame.dat that eventually gets passed to a WinAPI CreateFileA call. With x64dbg, I set
a breakpoint on CreateFileA to get the savegame.dat file’s HANDLE. The breakpoint was triggered after pressing start on
the game’s title screen. I then set a breakpoint for the WinAPI ReadFile function to get the address
of the buffer that the data was read into. From there, I set a memory access breakpoint on the buffer so it would break
when the buffer was getting parsed. The breakpoint was triggered in a memcpy and I used the breakpoint’s stacktrace
to pinpoint the functions of interest. Again, I was greeted with inheritance hierarchy hell but I was able to make sense
of it with dynamic analysis. The first DWORD of the savegame.dat file was compared to 0x31304653 (“10FS” in ASCII). If
they were equal, it would skip over a huge code block that continued parsing the save file. I overwrote the first DWORD
of my save file with the hard coded value and restarted my client. It unlocked chapters one, two, four, six, and seven
with every level in the chapter unlocked with an A+ rating! The Dark World levels were completed too!</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Nsn4QAS.png" alt="Unlocked chapters" title="Unlocked chapters after overwriting the save file" /></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2K4QvYf.png" alt="Unlocked levels" title="Unlocked levels after overwriting the save file" /></p>

<p>This code was probably used for testing during development and accidentally made it into production. It could
easily be patched out by the developers if they wanted to, but I don’t see why they’d bother since it’s a single player
game. Anyway I ended up restoring my old save file to avoid ruining the game. Hopefully this time I can beat the level
without resorting to cheating.</p>
